                            Uncontrolled components are the components that are not fully controlled by React. Moreover,these components keep their own state internally. They update their state based on the user input. On the other hand ,controlled components are form components that are fully controlled by React. The state of a controlled component is stored in the parent component, and it is passed down to the component as props. All changes to the component's state are managed by the parent component, and the component re-renders with updated props.

                            PropTypes is a mechanism that is used to specify and ensure the type of data that is passed to a component through its props is of the correct datatype. To use PropTypes, 'prop-types' package needs to be imported and then define the PropTypes for each of the props that your component expects.

                            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment and library built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a client's browser, which can be useful for building backend services, command line tools, or even desktop or mobile applications. Express.js, on the other hand, is a Node.js web application framework. It provides a set of tools, utilities and broad featured for building web and mobile applications, such as middleware for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, and templating. In other words, Node.js is the underlying platform, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that helps build web applications, manage servers and routes.

                            A custom hook is a javaScript function which we create by ourself. It reuses one or more React-hook to encapsulate common logics that can shared among any component. It allows us to reuse code and simplify components, just like the javaScript utility function.
                            Custom hooks can be useful for abstracting away complex logic and making it easier to manage state across multiple components. One might create a custom hook to handle things like form validation, managing API requests, or handling global state and etc etc.
